# Generate Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) - Two Truths & A Lie Game

Transform planning output into comprehensive, implementation-ready PRPs for the Two Truths & A Lie voting game system that preserve research context and provide intelligent coordination for real-time voting architecture.

## Planning File: $ARGUMENTS

Input: Planning documents from `PRPs/1-planning/`  
Output: Implementation-ready PRPs in `PRPs/2-prps/{{ PRP.NUMBER }}_feature-name.md`

## ðŸŽ¯ Comprehensive PRP Generation Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Create rich, context-aware PRPs that provide enough information for intelligent coordination without requiring user routing decisions. Every PRP should contain sufficient context for agents to make intelligent decisions about scope, complexity, and architectural integration requirements.

### Research-First Approach

All PRPs are generated with comprehensive research and context analysis:

1. **Planning Context Integration**: Extract all research, decisions, and constraints from planning documents
2. **Architectural Context**: Analyze integration requirements with existing components and systems
3. **MCP Research Integration**: Incorporate relevant research findings from Crawl4AI, Octocode, and SequentialThinking
4. **Codebase Analysis**: Understand existing patterns, integration points, and architectural dependencies
5. **Quality Context**: Include testing approaches, documentation requirements, and validation needs

### Real-Time Voting Architecture Integration

All PRPs are generated with the Two Truths & A Lie game's real-time voting architecture in mind:
- **Socket.io Integration**: Real-time WebSocket communication for live voting updates
- **Game State Management**: In-memory voting state with session-based duplicate prevention
- **React Component Coordination**: Frontend voting interface with live results updates
- **Test IO Brand Compliance**: Professional blue/teal color palette and clean layouts

## ðŸ“‹ PRP Generation Process

### Phase 1: Planning Analysis & Context Extraction (10-15 min)

#### 1. Deep Planning Analysis
```markdown
- **Read planning document completely**
- **Extract research context** (what investigations were already done)
- **Identify architectural scope** (component integration requirements)
- **Understand user requirements** and success criteria
- **Note constraints and dependencies** identified during planning
```

#### 2. MCP Research Integration  
```markdown
- **Crawl4AI**: Integrate relevant framework documentation research
- **Octocode**: Include proven implementation patterns from similar features
- **SequentialThinking**: Incorporate architectural decision analysis
- **Tech Guide References**: Connect with established project patterns
```

#### 3. Voting Game Architectural Analysis
```markdown
- **Socket.io Integration**: WebSocket event handling and real-time communication
- **Game State Flow**: Voting session management and result aggregation
- **React Component Dependencies**: Admin setup, voting interface, and results pages
- **Test IO Brand Requirements**: Color palette compliance and professional styling
```

### Phase 2: Complexity Assessment & Agent Coordination Strategy (5-10 min)

#### Intelligent Complexity Detection
```markdown
**File Count Impact**: Number of files likely to be modified
**Integration Complexity**: Cross-component coordination requirements  
**Research Depth**: Amount of additional investigation needed
**Risk Assessment**: Potential for architectural changes or breaking changes
**Time Estimation**: Realistic implementation timeline
```

#### Smart Agent Coordination Recommendations
```markdown
- **Simple Features** (1-3 files, <2 hours): Direct agent assignment
- **Moderate Features** (4-8 files, 2-8 hours): task-coordinator for workflow management
- **Complex Features** (9+ files, >8 hours): Multi-phase coordination with checkpoints
- **Architectural Changes**: Always recommend task-coordinator for complex coordination
```

### Phase 3: Comprehensive PRP Document Creation (15-20 min)

#### Core PRP Structure
Use template structure adapted for project context:

```markdown
